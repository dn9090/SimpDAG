# SimpDAG - Simple graph implementations.

This repository contains graph implementations that are easy to program, simple
and more efficient than comparable OOP approaches.
The implementations provide only approaches, often not complete workouts of the interfaces,
and are intended only as examples of more advanced data structures.
